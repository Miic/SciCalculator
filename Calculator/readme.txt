Bugs / Defects Encountered During Testing: 
- Float adding with operator as a Float rather than an operator, causing miscalculations. Solved by: Adding empty string before adding to operator char to force String additions
- Fixed Bug Regarding Divide by 0 and Error Cases not being properly removed by detection using Regex Statements.
- Fixed Bug Regarding Infinity Cases, such as being unable to use infinity in operations and being able to perform operations onto the Infinity as a literal String like "Infinty5" or "Infin"
